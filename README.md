# Udacity-Project-Movie-Trailer-Website
This was my second project for the Udacity Fullstack Web Development Online Nano Degree.

This project required me to create a Python class for creating movie instances. The code generates an HTML page that features
responsive design and Bootstrap modals to view the youtube url associated with each movie instance. Data is injected into the HTML at generation using the Jinja2 template language.

Files:
* entertainment_center.py
* fresh_tomatoes.py
* media.py
* fresh_tomatoes.html
       
### Programming Language: Python 2.7
### Template Language: Jinja2 (2.9)
### CSS Framework: Twitter Bootstrap 4

Usage: `python entertainment_center.py`

Input: modify the movies list in entertainment_center.py to change ouput

Output: fresh_tomatoes.html
